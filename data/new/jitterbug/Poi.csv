(In the result "after the 'e'" and "before the        * first digit" are the same because the result has no extra chars to be in        * the way.)        *        * (4) In the output remove the sign if it should not be shown ("e-" was used        * and the sign is negative) or set it to the correct value.         */

Poi,WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION,//  Quoting is very awkward.  In the Java classes quoting is done   between ' chars with '' meaning a single ' char. The problem is that   in Excel it is legal to have two adjacent escaped strings.  For   example consider the Excel format "\a\b#".  The naive (and easy)   translation into Java DecimalFormat is "'a''b'#".  For the number 17   in Excel you would get "ab17" but in Java it would be "a'b17" -- the   '' is in the middle of the quoted string in Java.  So the trick we   use is this: When we encounter a ' char in the Excel format we   output a \u0000 char into the string.  Now we know that any '' in the   output is the result of two adjacent escaped strings.  So after the   main loop we have to do two passes: One to eliminate any ''   sequences to make "'a''b'" become "'ab'" and another to replace any   \u0000 with '' to mean a quote char.  Oy.     For formats that don't use "'" we don't do any of this

This bug was caused by a combination of invalid sheet indexes in the EXTERNSHEET		record and eager initialisation of the extern sheet references. Note - the workbook		has 2 sheets but the EXTERNSHEET record refers to sheet indexes 0 1 and 2.		Offset 0x3954 (14676)		recordid = 0x17 size = 32		[EXTERNSHEET]		   numOfRefs	 = 5		refrec		 #0: extBook=0 firstSheet=0 lastSheet=0		refrec		 #1: extBook=1 firstSheet=2 lastSheet=2		refrec		 #2: extBook=2 firstSheet=1 lastSheet=1		refrec		 #3: extBook=0 firstSheet=-1 lastSheet=-1		refrec		 #4: extBook=0 firstSheet=1 lastSheet=1		[/EXTERNSHEET]		As it turns out the formula in question doesn't even use externSheetIndex #1 - it		uses #4 which resolves to sheetIndex 1 -> 'Data'.		It is not clear exactly what externSheetIndex #4 would refer to.  Excel seems to		display such a formula as "''!$A2" but then complains of broken link errors.		 */

One extra complication is that bof+eof sub-		* streams can be nested within worksheet streams and it's not clear in these cases what		* record might follow any EOF record.
