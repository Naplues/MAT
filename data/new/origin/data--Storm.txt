/*         Without fragmentation, the cluster would be able to schedule both topologies on each node. Let's call each node        with both topologies scheduled as 100% scheduled.        We schedule the cluster in 3 blocks of topologies, measuring the time to schedule the blocks. The first, middle        and last blocks attempt to schedule the following 0-10%, 10%-90%, 90%-100%. The last block has a number of        scheduling failures due to cluster fragmentation and its time is dominated by attempting to evict topologies.        Timing results for scheduling are noisy. As a result, we do multiple runs and use median values for FirstBlock        and LastBlock times. (somewhere a statistician is crying).

//  We have three mutually disjoint treesets per shard at any given time to keep track of what sequence number   can be committed to zookeeper.   emittedPerShard, ackedPerShard and failedPerShard. Any record starts by entering emittedPerShard. On ack   it moves from emittedPerShard to   ackedPerShard and on fail if retry service tells us to retry then it moves from emittedPerShard to   failedPerShard. The failed records will move from   failedPerShard to emittedPerShard when the failed record is emitted again as a retry.   Logic for deciding what sequence number to commit is find the highest sequence number from ackedPerShard   called X such that there is no sequence   number Y in emittedPerShard or failedPerShard that satisfies X > Y. For e.g. if ackedPerShard is 1,4,5,   emittedPerShard is 2,6 and   failedPerShard is 3,7 then we can only commit 1 and not 4 because 2 is still pending and 3 has failed

The reason for this is to try and balance the maximum pause time GC might take (which is larger for larger heaps)   against better performance because of not needing to serialize/deserialize tuples.
