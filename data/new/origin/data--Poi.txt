(In the result, "after the 'e'" and "before the        * first digit" are the same because the result has no extra chars to be in        * the way.)        *        * (4) In the output, remove the sign if it should not be shown ("e-" was used        * and the sign is negative) or set it to the correct value.         */

//  Quoting is very awkward.  In the Java classes, quoting is done   between ' chars, with '' meaning a single ' char. The problem is that   in Excel, it is legal to have two adjacent escaped strings.  For   example, consider the Excel format "\a\b#".  The naive (and easy)   translation into Java DecimalFormat is "'a''b'#".  For the number 17,   in Excel you would get "ab17", but in Java it would be "a'b17" -- the   '' is in the middle of the quoted string in Java.  So the trick we   use is this: When we encounter a ' char in the Excel format, we   output a \u0000 char into the string.  Now we know that any '' in the   output is the result of two adjacent escaped strings.  So after the   main loop, we have to do two passes: One to eliminate any ''   sequences, to make "'a''b'" become "'ab'", and another to replace any   \u0000 with '' to mean a quote char.  Oy.     For formats that don't use "'" we don't do any of this

Obtain the intermediate key by decrypting the encryptedKeyValue from a KeyEncryptor         *    contained within the KeyEncryptors sequence. Use this key for encryption operations in the         *    remaining steps of this section.         * 2. Generate a random array of bytes, known as Salt, of the same length as the value of the         *    KeyData.hashSize attribute.         * 3. Encrypt the random array of bytes generated in step 2 by using the binary form of the         *    KeyData.saltValue attribute and a blockKey byte array consisting of the following bytes:         *    0x5f, 0xb2, 0xad, 0x01, 0x0c, 0xb9, 0xe1, and 0xf6 used to form an initialization vector as         *    specified in section 2.3.4.12. If the array of bytes is not an integral multiple of blockSize         *    bytes, pad the array with 0x00 to the next integral multiple of blockSize bytes.         * 4. Assign the encryptedHmacKey attribute to the base64-encoded form of the result of step 3.         * 5. Generate an HMAC, as specified in [RFC2104], of the encrypted form of the data (message),         *    which the DataIntegrity element will verify by using the Salt generated in step 2 as the key.         *    Note that the entire EncryptedPackage stream (1), including the StreamSize field, MUST be         *    used as the message.         * 6. Encrypt the HMAC as in step 3 by using a blockKey byte array consisting of the following bytes:         *    0xa0, 0x67, 0x7f, 0x02, 0xb2, 0x2c, 0x84, and 0x33.         * 7.

//  Multiple calls to autoSizeColumn need to look up the best-fit width   of rows already flushed to disk plus re-calculate the best-fit width   of rows in the current window. It isn't safe to update the column   widths before flushing to disk because columns in the random access   window rows may change in best-fit width. The best-fit width of a cell   is only fixed when it becomes inaccessible for modification.   Changes to the shared strings table, styles table, or formulas might   be able to invalidate the auto-size width without the opportunity   to recalculate the best-fit width for the flushed rows. This is an   inherent limitation of SXSSF. If having correct auto-sizing is   critical, the flushed rows would need to be re-read by the read-only

The output precision defines how closely the font is required to match the requested height, width,   character orientation, escapement, pitch, and font type.   It MUST be a value from the WMF OutPrecision enumeration.   Applications can use the output precision to control how the font mapper chooses a font when the   operating system contains more than one font with a specified name. For example, if an operating   system contains a font named Symbol in rasterized and TrueType forms, an output precision value   of OUT_TT_PRECIS forces the font mapper to choose the TrueType version.   A value of OUT_TT_ONLY_PRECIS forces the font mapper to choose a TrueType font, even if it is

/* 		* How to recognise end of stream?		* In the best case, the underlying input stream (in) ends just after the last EOF record		* Usually however, the stream is padded with an arbitrary byte count.  Excel and most apps		* reliably use zeros for padding and if this were always the case, this code could just		* skip all the (zero sized) records with sid==0.  However, bug 46987 shows a file with		* non-zero padding that is read OK by Excel (Excel also fixes the padding).		*		* So to properly detect the workbook end of stream, this code has to identify the last		* EOF record.  This is not so easy because the worbook bof+eof pair do not bracket the		* whole stream.  The worksheets follow the workbook, but it is not easy to tell how many		* sheet sub-streams should be present.  Hence we are looking for an EOF record that is not		* immediately followed by a BOF record.  One extra complication is that bof+eof sub-		* streams can be nested within worksheet streams and it's not clear in these cases what		* record might follow any EOF record.  So we also need to keep track of the bof/eof		* nesting level.		 */
