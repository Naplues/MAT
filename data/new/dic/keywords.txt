trial and error
give up
this is wrong
hang our heads in shame
temporary solution
causes issue
something bad is going on
cause for issue
this doesn't look right
is this next line safe
this indicates a more fundamental problem
temporary crutch
this can be a mess
this isn't very solid
this is temporary and will go away
is this line really safe
there is a problem
some fatal error
something serious is wrong
don't use this
get rid of this
doubt that this would work
this is bs
give up and go away
risk of this blowing up
just abandon it
prolly a bug
probably a bug
hope everything will work
